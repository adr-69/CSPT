    <h2>What is a Vulnerability Scanner?</h2>
    <h2>A Vulnerability Scanner is a tool used in cybersecurity to detect security weaknesses in systems, services, or software. It identifies known vulnerabilities on open ports and services that could be exploited by attackers.</h2>
    <br />
    <h2>Why is Vulnerability Scanning Important in Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing?</h2>
    <h2>Vulnerability scanning is a critical step because it:</h2>

    <ul class="full-list">
      <li>Helps discover weak or outdated services running on a system</li>
      <li>Highlights high-risk targets (e.g., SMB vulnerabilities like EternalBlue)</li>
      <li>Assists ethical hackers in prioritizing exploitation paths</li>
      <li>Enables early detection and patching of exploitable issues</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>This scanning helps simulate what an attacker might try so security flaws can be fixed before they’re abused.</h2>
