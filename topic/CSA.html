    <h2>What is a Credential Stuffing Attack?</h2>
    <h2>A Credential Stuffing Attack is a type of cyberattack where stolen login credentials (usually obtained from a previous data breach) are used to gain unauthorized access to user accounts on various online platforms. In this attack, automated scripts are used to test large sets of usernames and passwords across multiple websites, with the hope that users have reused the same credentials across different platforms.</h2>
    <br />
    <h2>Why is it Important in Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing?</h2>
    <h2>Credential stuffing is crucial for penetration testing because it highlights:</h2>

    <ul class="full-list">
      <li>The risks of using the same credentials across multiple platforms.</li>
      <li>The importance of strong, unique passwords for each account.</li>
      <li>The need for mechanisms to detect and block repeated login attempts (e.g., CAPTCHA, IP blocking).</li>
      <li>The necessity of enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) to protect accounts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ethical hacking teams use credential stuffing simulations to identify potential weaknesses in account security systems and help organizations improve their defenses against this type of attack.</h2>
    
    <h2>Python Code: Credential Stuffing Simulation</h2>
    <div class="box-code">
<pre><code>
# credential_stuffing_sim.py
# Educational purpose only

# Simulated valid credentials in a database
valid_credentials = {
"user1@example.com": "password123",
"admin@example.com": "admin2025",
"test@demo.com": "qwerty123"
}

# Stolen credentials (from a breached list)
stolen_creds = [
("user1@example.com", "password123"), # valid
("user2@example.com", "123456"), # invalid
("admin@example.com", "wrongpass"), # invalid
("admin@example.com", "admin2025"), # valid
("test@demo.com", "qwerty123"), # valid
("unknown@fake.com", "nopass"), # invalid
]
